# Post-App

Post-App is a simple yet powerful web application built with JavaScript. It is designed to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API, a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Patch, Delete) operations on posts.

## Features

- Fetch all posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Fetch a single post by its ID from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Create a new post on the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Update a post on the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Patch a post on the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Delete a post on the JSONPlaceholder API.

## How to Run

To run the Post-App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (the project is set up for IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.2).
3. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the application.

Please note that the Post-App is a front-end only application and does not require a server to run. However, you will need an active internet connection to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API.
